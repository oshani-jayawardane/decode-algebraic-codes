# decode-algebraic-codes
This repository contains the code files of the study presented in our paper "A Low-Complexity Algorithm to Globally Recover Algebraic Codes over Finite Fields".

We attempt to decode algebraic codes over finite fields by combining classical algebraic techniques with structure-imposed neural networks. The project addresses both local recovery and global reconstruction of codewords transmitted over noisy or lossy channels.

### Preliminary Experiments
These notebooks were used to understand and validate DFT/DCT behavior before imposing structure on the networks.
